# Invisible-cloak-using-opencv
I have written this code to make one invisible if he/ she uses a red-colored cloth to cover the frame. The project is written in python because of the extensive use of
OpenCV and NumPy libraries. The project is based on **color detection** and *segmentation*. I have used a red-cloth here, but the code can be manipulated for any color. The
project's logic is to take the first frame/capture and then add it to the detected segment of the current frame.
